## FIXME
|        Issue        | Description                         |
|:-------------------:|:------------------------------------|
|  **Reservation**    | When someone who is not logged in starts searching for a property and tries to book, they need to log in (it's already implemented), but after logging in, they go back to the home page, and we have to get them in reservation page. |
|**Profile Pictures** | Old profile pictures are not being deleted yet, FIXME tag in includes/images.php. Currently pictures are being overwritten. |
